        <h2>Dinner And Breakfast</h2><br>
        <span><img class="three" src="food.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"></span><img class="three" src="food2.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"><img class="three" src="food1.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px">
        <p><h3>One of the biggest factors that goes into selecting your food options for a wedding is the time of day your reception is. The time can dictate what type of food you serve, from a full meal to just appetizers and hors d’oeuvres.
          You may want your guests to get up and mingle instead of feeling tied to their table eating a full meal — to encourage this, you might decide to serve smaller plates such as appetizers and hors d’oeuvres. This may seem like a good idea in theory, but if you are asking friends and family to join you during a “meal time,” it is highly recommended to serve a full meal instead of snacks. It’s no fun being hungry and you would not want your guests to leave early because they need to eat!

        <h2>Bridal and Groom Makeup</h2><br>
        <span><img class="three" src="bridal.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"></span><img class="three" src="makeup.jpeg.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"><img class="three" src="makeup1.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px">
        <p><h3> Bridal makeup should reflect your personality (your wedding is a milestone, not a frequent life occurrence), complement your outfit (obviously), and most importantly, stay put through the entire ceremony and the photographs.
        </h3></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Return Gifts</h2><br>
        <span><img class="three" src="return.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"></span><img class="three" src="return1.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px"><img class="three" src="return2.jpeg" height="200px" width="400px">
        <p><h3>Gifts are the best way to show someone you care. Giving someone a gift shows gratitude and appreciation for them, their time, and the effort spent on your big day. A return gift is a token of gratitude towards your guests for sharing the most important day of your life. It shows how much you care about them!</h3></p>
